# Single-Cycle-MIPS-Processor

design a 32-Bit single cycle MIPS microprocessor (RISC-Like Harvard Architecture), Using Verilog HDL.
to test and verify the design we ran the following programs:
-Get the factorial of 7.
-Get the greatest common divisor (GCD) between 120 and 180.
-Get the Fibonacci sequence.

the reference "Digital design and computer architecture" helped me a lot in designing the microprocessor
